# tmuxake 

A side-pane manager for tmux
============================

Tmux is a great terminal emulator! I can't live without it any more.

Often I need to lookup some man pages or try a command, ... and I need more
room in my terminal for that. Tmux allows me to split into more panes to run
commands but those panes take space, so I end up closing the extra pane just
to open it a few seconds later to check something else. I can open an extra
window but then I don't see other panes. Working with sessions is even more
difficult. Tmux has all the necessary functionality but remembering all the
commands and bindings is difficult.

What I want is some temporary pane in my console that will go away when I am
done with them and come back when I need them.

Tmuxake creates and manages side-panes for you. Open a side pane, do some work,
close the side pane, re-open it later. move the side-panes around, detach them,
break them away, push them on a stack in a session and pop them from the stack 
in another session!

Working with tmuxake is like working with tmux, once you have set you bindings
you will feel little difference, tmuxake integrates in the tmux status bar and
in you shell prompt to give you some status about the side-panes you are using.

tmuxake --help is the manual.
