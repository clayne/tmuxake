tmuxake
-------

don't blindly kill panes
	send sigterm
	check if more than bash is running and warn

full-size side-pane, one that takes over the root pane

Attach and detach side-panes, this allows for cross session
	side-panes 

tweek the size of root-panes after side-panes are hidden, it is
	sometimes difficult to understand how tmux resize panes
	when a pane is closed
